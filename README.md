# Nyborg-Aktivitetspark

## Update: 0.0.2
 - The Javascript has been removed, and will probably be added at a later date. 

- The base of the scroll aspect in the HTML and CSS code has been used from the guide by "Omerko" on YouTube. (YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgrZOom6jMg, CodePen: https://codepen.io/omerko96/pen/abNPMbb)

- The plan is to use the base he has created and start from there. The goal will to have a webpage that will move horizontally and have parallax. Hopefully, to make the page more 
  digestible and presentable for potential users.
